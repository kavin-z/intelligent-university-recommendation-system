These principles are further combined with the principals of medical sciences aiming to streamline the healthcare services. The health care expenditure is likely to witness an increase due to the rise of population growth. Furthermore, spreading awareness of medical advancements have led to an increase in the number of people seeking biomedical solutions for their health issues. Biomedical engineers' employment will eventually rise as a result of this. These facts are evident to prove that the growth rate of biomedical engineers is likely to be much faster than the average pace for all the existing occupations. The study of biomedical engineering involves a broad array of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. This branch of engineering and sciences is a fascinating multidisciplinary area of study that entails the application of engineering techniques in order to assist medical practitioners in their healthcare practices. The possibilities within biomedical engineering are nearly endless.
